# Yen_Futures

Based on the time series analysis I would by the yen now. ARMA and ARIMA model predict an upward trend of price movement. The GARCH model indicates that the risk of Yen is predicted to increase. I think i would feel comfortable using these models.

The RSME for the out-of-sample is lower than the in-sample RMSE. RMSE is typically lower for training data, but in this case the in sample RSME is higher. In this case the model performed better with out-sample data.
